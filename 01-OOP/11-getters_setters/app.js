/* --------------------------------- Getters --------------------------------- */

/* 

--> Javascript provides syntax to write special methods that allows us to define a particular way to retrieve or update the value of specific object properties.


--> We will start with getters.

  -> Getters allow us to write a special method that will retrieve the value of an object's property.
  
  -> We don't call this method, we treat it as a property.

  -> It is kind of a property that is doing some logic behind the scenes.

  -> In this example, since the diameter is calculated through the value of the radius, we don't need to make a separate property for it.

    -> Also, that wouldn't make much sense because if we change the radius, then we would need to change the diameter to, because it is not being dynamically calculated.

    -> It would be defined when we create a new instance, but if we change the value of radius, the diameter stays the same.


  -> We could also create a regular method to retrieve the diameter, it would work the same way, but we would have to call it.

    -> By calling it, we would have to store it into a variable to read the value returned.

    -> The best solution is to create a getter, which we can treat as a property that we can read.


--> In conclusion, a getter allows us to define what looks like a property, but runs some logic behind the scenes.

  -> It is useful when we have properties that are derived based on other values that we already have.

  -> And also when we don't want to give direct access to a property which should only be accessed inside of the class.

/* --------------------------------- Setters --------------------------------- */

/* 

--> Setters allow us to provide a mechanism to update a property but, again some logic is being done in the background.

--> For example we can add some validation before allowing the property value to be changed.

--> With the _ signal, developers know that they should not update that value directly, to do it, they should use the setter.


--> We use setters when we want to provide a mechanism for someone to update something like it is a property but have some logic behind the scenes.
